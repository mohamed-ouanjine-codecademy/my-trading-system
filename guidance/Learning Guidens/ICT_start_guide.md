# Where to Start with ICT (Inner Circle Trader)

If you're new to ICT concepts and want to start learning in a structured way, here's a clear path to get started:

## 1. **Start with the 2022 Mentorship Series**
- ICT himself recommends starting with this free series as itâ€™s structured to introduce his methodology in a clear and progressive way.
- The first video in the series is titled "ICT Mentorship 2022" on his YouTube channel. This will help you gradually understand key concepts without being overwhelmed.

## 2. **Key Concepts to Focus on Early**:
Here are the foundational ICT concepts to study early in the journey:

- **Order Blocks**: These are price zones where large institutional orders are placed, often leading to price reversals or continuation. They help you pinpoint areas to enter or exit trades.
  
- **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**: Gaps between candlesticks that suggest an imbalance in price. Price tends to return to these areas before continuing in its original direction.

- **Liquidity Pools**: Areas on the chart where stop losses are likely placed, such as above previous highs or below previous lows. Liquidity zones help identify where the market is likely to move next.

## 3. **Backtesting & Practice**:
- As you learn these concepts, continue backtesting them alongside your current strategy. You can test ICT principles like order blocks and liquidity in combination with your trend-following method to see how they can offer additional trade setups.

## 4. **Take It One Concept at a Time**:
- Focus on mastering one ICT concept at a time before moving to the next. For example, start by learning how to identify **order blocks**. Once you feel comfortable with that, you can move on to **fair value gaps** and so on.

This gradual approach will allow you to expand your trading toolkit while maintaining the core of your current successful strategy.

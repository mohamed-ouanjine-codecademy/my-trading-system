# English Speaking Practice Guide

-   **Start with a Keyword**: Use a specific keyword or phrase to indicate the beginning of the speaking practice session, such as "Let's start the speaking session."
-   **Instruction Reminder**: Include a reminder in your opening statement, such as "Please correct my mistakes during this session."


**For example:**

-   "Let's start the speaking session. Please correct my mistakes during this session."

Additionally, you can also keep a note of any recurring mistakes or areas you want to focus on, and mention them at the beginning of each session. This can help target specific areas for improvement.

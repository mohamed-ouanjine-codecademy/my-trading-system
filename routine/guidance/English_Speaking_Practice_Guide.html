<li><strong>Start with a Keyword</strong>: Use a specific keyword or phrase to indicate the beginning of the speaking practice session, such as “Let’s start the speaking session.”</li>
<li><strong>Instruction Reminder</strong>: Include a reminder in your opening statement, such as “Please correct my mistakes during this session.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Let’s start the speaking session. Please correct my mistakes during this session.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can also keep a note of any recurring mistakes or areas you want to focus on, and mention them at the beginning of each session. This can help target specific areas for improvement.</p>

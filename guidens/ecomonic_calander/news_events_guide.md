# Key News Events to Monitor

1.  **Federal Reserve (Fed) Announcements**:
    
    -   **Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meetings**: These meetings occur eight times a year, where the Fed decides on monetary policy, including interest rates. Higher interest rates can strengthen the USD, making gold less attractive as an investment.
    -   **Fed Chair Speeches**: Statements by the Fed Chair can signal future policy moves. Hawkish (favoring higher rates) statements can pressure gold prices, while dovish (favoring lower rates) statements can support them.
2.  **US Economic Data**:
    
    -   **Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP)**: Released on the first Friday of every month, this report shows the number of jobs added or lost in the US economy. Strong NFP figures can boost the USD, negatively affecting gold prices.
    -   **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Measures inflation by tracking the change in prices for a basket of goods and services. High inflation can lead to higher gold prices as gold is seen as an inflation hedge.
    -   **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: Quarterly data showing the health of the economy. Strong GDP growth can strengthen the USD and weigh on gold prices.
    -   **Retail Sales**: Monthly data that measures consumer spending. Higher retail sales can indicate a strong economy, potentially boosting the USD and impacting gold negatively.
    -   **Initial Jobless Claims**: Weekly data indicating the number of people filing for unemployment benefits. Lower claims suggest a stronger job market, which can support the USD.
3.  **Geopolitical Events**:
    
    -   **Political Instability**: Events like elections, wars, or political unrest can drive investors to the safe haven of gold.
    -   **Trade Wars**: Tensions between major economies (e.g., US-China trade relations) can create uncertainty, supporting gold prices.
4.  **Central Bank Gold Purchases**:
    
    -   Reports on central banks buying or selling gold can influence market sentiment and prices. Large purchases can signal strong demand and drive prices higher.
5.  **Currency Movements**:
    
    -   **US Dollar Index (DXY)**: The value of the USD against a basket of other major currencies. A stronger USD makes gold more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing demand.
6.  **Interest Rates and Bond Yields**:
    
    -   **US Treasury Yields**: Rising yields can make bonds more attractive compared to gold, which doesn’t yield interest, leading to lower gold prices.
7.  **Inflation Expectations**:
    
    -   Reports on inflation expectations can influence gold prices. Higher expected inflation can boost demand for gold as a hedge.
8.  **Commodity Prices**:
    
    -   Prices of other commodities like oil can influence gold. Rising oil prices can lead to higher inflation, which may support gold prices.

### **Refined Strategy – Trend Momentum Strategy (TMS)**

#### **1. Trend Identification:**

-   **200 SMMA:** Continue using this as the main trend direction indicator.
-   **50 SMMA (added):** Use a 50 SMMA alongside the 200 SMMA to capture **shorter-term trends** within the larger move.
    -   **Bullish Trend:** 50 SMMA above the 200 SMMA, price above both.
    -   **Bearish Trend:** 50 SMMA below the 200 SMMA, price below both.

#### **2. Entry Signals:**

**Refine the Candlestick Patterns for Entries:**

-   **Engulfing Candles:** Keep using them but with confirmation from an additional **momentum indicator**.
    -   **RSI Filtering:** RSI must **cross above 55** for longs or **below 45** for shorts at the time of the engulfing candle. This helps ensure that momentum is on your side.
        
    -   **Second Entry Filter:** Incorporate your second entry concept. Look for the price to breach the high (or low) of the previous bar twice, increasing the likelihood that the trend will continue.
        
    -   **Avoid Choppy Markets:** Only trade engulfing patterns that are **at least 2-3 candles after a clear retracement**, not immediately after small consolidations.
        

#### **3. Momentum Confirmation:**

Use the **MACD** (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) as a momentum filter:

-   **MACD Line Crossing Above Signal Line:** Confirms bullish momentum. Look for this after a retracement in an uptrend before entering a long trade.
-   **MACD Line Crossing Below Signal Line:** Confirms bearish momentum. Look for this after a pullback in a downtrend before entering a short trade.

----------

#### **4. Fibonacci Levels (added for precision):**

Incorporate **Fibonacci Retracement** for added precision in determining when to enter after a pullback.

-   **Entry at 38.2% or 50% retracement:** When you see a pullback to these levels, look for a confluence of your other signals (RSI, MACD) to enter the trade. These levels are common areas where trends resume.

#### **5. Trade Management:**

-   **Risk-Reward Ratio:** Keep aiming for a minimum **1:2 risk-reward** ratio but adjust stop loss and take profit based on key **Fibonacci levels**.
    
    -   For long trades, stop loss goes slightly below the recent swing low, targeting 161.8% Fibonacci extension for profit.
    -   For short trades, stop loss goes above the recent swing high, targeting the same 161.8% extension.
-   **Trailing Stop (optional refinement):** Once the trade moves in your favor by 1.5x the risk, move your stop loss to break-even. You can also trail it using the 50 SMMA for a more dynamic exit strategy.
    

----------

### **6. Risk Management:**

-   **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Calculate your lot size based on how far your stop loss is from the entry point to ensure you risk the same percentage of your account (e.g., 1-2%) per trade. This keeps your risk consistent and manageable.
    
-   **Limit Trade Frequency:** Trade only when all conditions align. This might limit the number of trades but will help in increasing your win rate and reducing unnecessary losses.
    

----------

### **New Strategy Overview:**

#### **1. Identify Trend:**

-   200 SMMA for overall trend direction.
-   50 SMMA for intermediate trends.

#### **2. Entry Conditions:**

-   Engulfing candles as a signal.
-   RSI above 55 for long trades, below 45 for short trades.
-   MACD confirmation of momentum (MACD line crossing signal line).
-   Price pulls back to 38.2% or 50% Fibonacci level.

#### **3. Risk Management:**

-   Risk 1-2% of account per trade.
-   1:2 risk-reward ratio or better.
-   Trailing stop based on 50 SMMA.

#### **4. Exit Strategy:**

-   Initial stop below/above swing low/high.
-   Target 161.8% Fibonacci extension.
-   Trail stop once 1.5x risk is hit.

----------

### **Additional Notes:**

-   **Combine Second Entry Concept:** Only take the second breach of a high/low after a pullback if it's in line with your trend-following criteria.
-   **Timeframe:** Stick to **higher timeframes (H1 or H4)** for better trend clarity and avoid choppy price action on smaller timeframes.

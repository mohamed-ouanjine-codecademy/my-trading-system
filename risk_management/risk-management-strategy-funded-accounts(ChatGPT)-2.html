</table><h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Initial Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the initial risk per trade to 2-3% of the allowed trading amount to prevent significant early drawdowns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progressive Risk Reduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to reduce risk per trade after a certain number of consecutive losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cap Total Drawdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the total drawdown does not exceed a certain percentage (e.g., 50-60% of the allowed trading amount) to avoid total capital loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

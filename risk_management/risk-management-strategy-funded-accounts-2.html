</table><h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial High Risk (7%):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The initial risk of 7% per trade on the allowed trading amount is high and could lead to significant drawdowns if a few trades go against you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progressive Risk Reduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you lose trades, you reduce the risk, which is a good risk management technique.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Drawdown Potential:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The total drawdown potential reaching 100% of the allowed trading amount indicates that with the maximum number of losing trades, you could lose all the amount you are allowed to trade with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adjusted-strategy-recommendations">Adjusted Strategy Recommendations:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Initial Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the initial risk per trade to 2-3% of the allowed trading amount to prevent significant early drawdowns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progressive Risk Reduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to reduce risk per trade after a certain number of consecutive losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cap Total Drawdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the total drawdown does not exceed a certain percentage (e.g., 50-60% of the allowed trading amount) to avoid total capital loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
